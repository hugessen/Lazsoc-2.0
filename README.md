Lazaridis Students' Society App v2.0 (alpha)

Yeah baby!! Total code refactor using Ionic 2 and AngularJS 2. Coding in Angular 2 is so freaking awesome!

To do:
[ ] Change the club selection page to actually select clubs, not just display clubpages
[ ] Find a way to save preference selection for clubs and interests
[ ] Once preferences work, implement Custom Newsfeed
[ ] Calendar integration
[ ] Facebook pages
[ ] ConnectivityMonitor to see if user is online
[ ] Implement Personal Information page.
